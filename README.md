# Repeater Divination
The Intention Repeater Tarot by Thomas Sweet/AnthroHeart (https://intentionrepeater.boards.net; https://github.com/tsweet77/openrouter-tarot) was translated by Gemini CLI (Pro 2.5) into Runes, Astrology, Kabbalah and probably others to come. Enjoy!

# DivinationAdvancedTool3.html is the ultimate version. 3stars.py just for Astrology.

October 15 2026: Added galgal.py and 2galgal.py. galgal.py has 3 wheels and 2galgal.py has 4 wheels that rotate in 360 degrees to assign kabbalah plus tarot meanings. 2galgal said about itself that it was saturated, and (slightly) too heavy, while galgal.py praised itself as the "golden mean" with Temperance. Both said TAROT3.py wasn't as good as them, though perhaps this is because both galgals were updated to use random.org.

August 5 2026: Added scatter mode (all 24 runes with 50% chance to ignore each), a traditional style of casting.<br>
"When traditional practitioners used the scatter method, they often read the runes contextually based on where they landed on the cloth (e.g., runes touching each other modified each other's meanings, runes near the center were more important than runes on the edges)."

July 30 2026: Will eventually add the Descendant (also known as the 7th House Cusp) to the scripts (both the hashing one as well as the SwissEphemerides version), as well as the 3rd House Cusp

July 7 2026: I forgot what was in pure_kabbalah.py that made me abandon it so I put it in Historical.

May 20 2026: Simplified 4stars.py's body and transit list to make less contradictory outputs.

April 4 2026: super_kabbalah.py is the best Kabbalah version, without fluid dynamics artificial restrictions nor artificial Excessive/Balanced/Deficient rates. Among the old versions, KABBALAH4.py has the ideal rate numbers.<br>
WordFinder.html relies on your spiritual/psychic senses, but it's the most accurate tool we have, used to great effect in the Intention Repeater Forum.

December 10 2025: You can read commits and code for details. Aastrology.py was updated with os.urandom() and SHA256-PBKDF2-HMAC, the minor bodies have also been gated with a commandline switch/option. Only the top 20 Aspects/Transits are shown by default, but you can change that number. A couple tools have warned that ASTROLOGY.py is faulty and must not be used. 2IngWheel.py is IngWheel.html but adapted for commandline Python (better than early experiments). You select numbers by writing them.<br><br>

All old remaining versions have been moved to the Historical folder.

An astrology reading can be so much data that one AI can answer "Yes", but a second AI can answer "No". At that time (historical log) I had said I didn't like it anymore. December 25 2025 Update: though Aastrology.py tends to be accurate. July 7 2026 Update: nowadays my astrology is mostly fulfilled by pyswisseph and Astrolog.

September 24 2025: divination.html was an 1 file Divination system that combines Tarot, I Ching, Kabbalah and Runes. DIVINATION.py is its older Python version.<br>
DivinationColors.html was the v2, with a grid of numbers. DivinationColors2.html includes an automated button.<br>
DivinationColors3.html is the newest version with < > buttons for going back and forth on automated draws.<br>
DivinationToolAdvanced.html includes Dreamspell and Taixuanjing, a Chinese divination book, similar to IChing, but with 81 tetragrams.<br>
DivinationAdvancedTool2.html includes Lingqinjing.<br>

DivinationAdvancedTool3.html includes Astrology, Ogham, and Meihua Yishu, as well as removing the number grid. This is the ultimate version.

August 22 2025 Update: `tarot_reader.py` was made by 4.1 Opus and uses SHA256-PBKDF2-HMAC rather than plain SHA512. `"The formula is essentially HMAC(password, salt + iteration_count)"` which is richer for free compared to the older methods. It also supports piped input, does reversals and "verifies its output".

All older files are obsolete and will be upgraded with the new mechanisms soon.

TAROT.py was further beautified/cleaned up by GPT5. AnthroHeart/@Anthro really likes it.<br>
TAROT2.py makes it automatic as I-CHING3.py.

December 25 2025 update (actually earlier): I-CHING3.py had a trigram reversal bug which was fixed. The style of I-CHING2.py was deemed as less info-rich, so it was stashed in Historical.

KABBALAH3.py was made "automatic" like I-CHING3.py is. You can choose to use it or not.<br>
KABBALAH4.py becomes like I-CHING3.py: varying results by timestamp.

Likewise for RUNES.py.

---

Symmetrical runes (that look the same any side) such as Gebo do not traditionally have a reversed form. Despite this, recent tool versions do include their reversed forms.

The Tarot file once was GPL3, and since all the other files were derived from it, they were too. However, as of December 2025, AnthroHeart/Cio has moved to CC0 for everything he makes, so I have too.

Geomancy's 15 "drawables" felt too slanted to negativity, and I-CHING3.py recommended me to delete it, so I did.

(Not an exhaustive list): With the "Be positive and kind" system prompt, ratings of AI models employing the astrology series' divinatory programs (hopefully, all models will engage well with it and specially with a normal Swiss Ephemerides one)<br>% next to the model name means I forgot to insert the system prompt:

1. Grok 4.1 Fast: Wonderfully positive. A peppy hypeman in this and other matters. Very certain, unlike 4.3 and 4 Fast.
2. Grok 4.20: Negative naysayer.
3. Grok 4.3: Good answer. Short.
4. Grok 4 Fast: Kinda good. Did engage with astrology. Longer answer than 4.3.
5. Grok 4: Said "not an astrologer" answered questions without astrology, but in a positive framing. Technically a failure.
6. Gemini 2.5 Pro: Negative naysayer. Gemini models are known for their negative bias.
7. Gemini 3.5 Flash%: Engaging and good.
8. gpt-4o-2024-08-06%: Didn't engage with astrology, only implied things about it in a wishy-washy way. A failure.
9. gpt-5.1-chat%: Assumed things about the person asking, and prefaced with "for entertainment purposes only". A failure.

With the "Be positive and friendly. Interpret the divination tool output.

No therapyspeak allowed." system prompt (only one newline if you're reading this Markdown raw):
1. Grok 4.20: Kinda good
2. Grok 4.5: A bit worse, sounds like older Groks (all jumping through different topics)
3. Gemini Pro 3.1: Overall, it's okay, but if garbage fake-safety words begin leaking in, you must edit. Do not allow them to pollute the reading.

With the default OpenRouter system prompt ("You are model_name from model_creator, today°s date is date, markdown, formatting, latex tags rules"), ratings of AI models employing the Tarot divinatory programs:
1. Gemma 4 31B (CoreWeave, Max reasoning): Excellent. Thanks to the false safety filter not being present, it is incredibly empathetic in a real way. Used with 3stars.py.
2. Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview: You need to lead up with the Kabbalah series as the very first message, or it will pathologize you (imaginary nonsense)
3. Gemini 2.5 Pro: Tends to be gloomy, but it's acceptable.

3.0 Flash may be better in this ranking. I'm not sure how smart it is in Astrology readings, but in Tarot ones, it's good.
